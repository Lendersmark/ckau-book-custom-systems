# batocera-custom-es_systems
EmulationStation displays systems based on a file called es_systems.cfg. In other distributions, this is typically the only file. However, in Batocera FIXME and higher, the /userdata/system/configs/emulationstation/es_systems_&lt;custom_name>.cfg can be used as an overlay to the original /usr/share/emulationstation/es_systems.cfg file.
